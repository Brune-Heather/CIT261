<h1>JavaScript - Week 02</h1>

<h2>Variables</h2>
   <!--
      Variables hold data. To create a variable the keyword var is put before the variable name. Variable names start with a letter, are case sensitive, and keywords cannot be used. Here the name of the variable is x and x is storing the value 12. Then the variable name is day and the value is "Tuesday".
   -->
   <pre>
      var x = 12;
      
      var day = "Tuesday";
   </pre>

<h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
   <!--
      The bold portion of the statement is a conditional. The contents between curly braces { } will be executed only if the condition evaluates to true.
   -->
   <pre>
      if ( <b>x > 5</b> ) {
         <i>code here...</i>
      }
   </pre>
   <!--
      Conditionals can be used in a lot of places. Their purpose is basically decision making. If it's raining, we will want and umbrella.
   -->
   <pre>
      if ( rain == true ) {
         umbrella = "Yes!";
      }
   </pre>

<h2>Switch Statement</h2>
   <!--
      A switch is another type of conditional. With a switch you have one input and several possible output matches. Each case has a break after the code except the default. Where the cases are labelled with 1 and 2 you can put any number or letter or string that you want to match with the conditional. If the condition doesn't match any of the cases, the default behavior will be triggered.
   -->
   <pre>
      switch ( conditional ) {
         case 1:
            <i>code here...</i>
            break;
         case 2:
            <i>code here...</i>
            break;
         default:
            <i>code here...</i>
      }
   </pre>
   <pre>
      switch ( day ) {
         case "Sat":
            alert = "Sleep in!"
            break;
         case "Sun":
            alert = "Go to Church!"
            break;
         default:
            alert = "Go to work!"
      }
   </pre>

<h2>Functions</h2>
   <!--
      Functions perform specific tasks. They can be anywhere in the code or in a separate file. Each function starts with the keyword function followed by the name of the function. In parenthesis after the are optional parameters or information being sent to the function from where it is called. A function can return data to the line it was called from or it can simply perform a task and return nothing.
   -->
   <pre>
      <b>function</b> nameIt ( parameter1, parameter2 ) {
         <i>code here...</i>
         return <i>something</i>;
      }
   </pre>
   <pre>
      function add ( num1, num 2) {
         return num1 + num2;
      }
   </pre>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
   <!--
      Parameters are optional and are found inside the parantheses of the function. Regardless of the name of the variable, you can call it anything in the parameter as its the value being passed, not the name. 
   -->
   <pre>
      function ftnName ( parameter1, parameter2 ) {
         return parameter1 + parameter2;
      }
   </pre>
   <p>
      <i>The function call might look like...</i>
   </p>
   <pre>
      ftnName(5, 9);
   </pre>

<h2>Loops</h2>
   <!--
      There are several different types of loops. For loops are the most common and will be used a lot with arrays. There are also while loops, and do/while loops. For loops will loops through a specific amount, while loops will trigger only if conditions are met and will continue until that condition is not longer met. Do/while loops will perform their task once and only continue if the condition is met.
   -->
   <h4>While Loop</h4>
   <pre>
      while (<i>condition</i>) {
         <i>code here...</i>
      }
   </pre>
   <h4>Do/While Loop</h4>
   <pre>
      do {
         <i>code here...</i>
      }
      while (<i>condition</i>);
   </pre>
   <h4>For Loop</h4>
   <pre>
      for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
         <i>code here...</i>
      }
   </pre>
   <p>
      Statement 1 is done before entering the { }. It is usually used to set a variable to count the number of loops. Such as:
   </p>
   <pre>
      var i = 0;
   </pre>
   <p>
      Statement 2 is the conditional to determine in the code inside the { } will be executed. For example:
   </p>
   <pre>
      i < 5;
   </pre>
   <p>
      Statement 3 is executed at the end of each loop through. It is often used to iterate the Statement 1. For example:
   </p>
   <pre>
      i++;
   </pre>
   <p>
      Putting it altogether:
   </p>
   <pre>   
      for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
         <i>code here...</i>
      }
   </pre>

<h2>Arrays</h2>
   <!--
      An array is just like a variable but it hold multiple values, like a list. There are different ways to create an array, see below, but usng the keyword new actually creates an object. To access an element in an array you use the variable name with [] and the position of the value you want. The first element is in position zero and the 2nd element is in position 1.
   -->
   <pre>
      var names = ["Heather", "John", "Abigail", "Moroni"];
   </pre>
   <pre>
      var names = new Array("Heather", "John", "Abigail", "Moroni");
   </pre>
   <p>
      If we want to access the value of "Moroni" we would do it like this:
   </p>
   <pre>
      names[3];
   </pre>
   <p>
      We could change "Moroni" to "Joseph" like this:
   </p>
   <pre>
      names[3] = "Joseph";
   </pre>
   <p>
      Now the array looks like this:
   </p>
   <pre>
      var names = ["Heather", "John", "Abigail", "Joseph"];
   </pre>
   <p>
      For loops are often used to loop through arrays. JavaScript has many built-in methods for interacting with <i>array</i>.length returning the legnth of the array. The name of your array will go in place of <i>array</i>. An interation through this array might look like this:
   </p>
   <pre>
      for(var i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
         studentsHere += names[i];
         return studentsHere;
      }
   </pre>
   <!--
      There are array methods for many things such as: sorting, adding to the array, and taking off the array. 
   -->

<h2>Associative Arrays</h2>
   <!--
      Javascript does not support associative arrays. Do not use these.
   -->
   <p>
      Do not do this:
   </p>
   <pre>
      var names = [];
      names["Teacher"] = "John";
      names["TA"] = "Heather";
      names["Student"] = "Abigail";
   </pre>
